      <h2>Kotlin-Android</h2>
      <p> Since we are not quite finished yet with scrum 4 and I havent taken CIS248 I will include a program that I did the majority the coding for in a different class,
         the idea was mine as well.  Since my son was diagnosed with diabetes I discovered there are no good apps for calculating insulin doses. So I had the idea to make one.
         my group mate took care of the coding of the database for the user. I organized everything  on all of the screens so it flowed nicely. I also wrote the program for 
         the actual calculator. The app is not quite how i want it to be yet. I plan to publish it on the Google Play store when it is up to my standards.  I want to add 
         functionality to recall at least the previous inputs and dosages for the last month.
      </p>
