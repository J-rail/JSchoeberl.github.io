      <h2>Kotlin-Android</h2>
      <p> This project is personal to me. October 2022 my son was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. I found insulin calculator apps to be lacking, they were essentially a basic 
        calculator with some extra diabetic language attached. This was not helpful for parent trying to learn how T1D works and how to keep ourselves from having to return to
        the hospital. I thought this would be a way to help new parents of T1D  children, as well as T1D people in general, especially in the early days when you have so much 
        to focus on learning, without having to take the time to make multiple calculations to figure out how much insulin to give. My goal is to revisit this project and 
        steamline it for release on Google Play.</p>
        
      <p>This particular project was done by 2 of us. My partner built the database and did all the research for that side of things. We worked together on the screens and  I
         programmed the actual calculator to function in the most efficient way possible. There are 3 calculations being made simultaneously. First the Carbs and carb ratio(this
         number comes from your endocrinologist) are calculated. Giving one part of the insulin dosage for carbohydrate correction.  Next the blood glucose, from either a glucose monitor or actual blood check, 
         target glucose and insulin sensitivity(both from your endocrinologist) are calculated. This step is actually provides 2 different numbers to divide to come up with a 
         glucose correction. Lastly the glucose correction and the carbohydrate correction are combined to give a total insulin dose.
