      <h2>Group Project in Python  with Pygame</h2>
      <p>This was a huge undertaking for 3 of us.  We found a youtube tutorial on how to build a game in the style of the original Legend of Zelda which can be found here 
        <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU1pPzEGrqw"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Youtube Tutorial</a>.  We wanted to make it our own, darker version. 
        One of us built the map using a program called Tiled. We all hunted for replacement sprites and particles, as well as sound effects. The only piece we used from the 
        tutorial was the music.  While the map was being  built the other 2 of us got to work following the tutorial video and editing  the code to work with our vision. My
         major contribution was the editing of the code, bug hunting, troubleshooting, and fixing errors. The game itself is incomplete due to time our constraints, but you can 
         see the amount of effort we put into it.
